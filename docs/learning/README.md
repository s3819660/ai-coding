# 🎓 AI Coding Learning Path

Welcome to your personal handbook for mastering AI-assisted development. This documentation is structured to take you from core concepts to advanced agentic workflows.

## 🗺️ Curriculum Map

### 1. [The AI Coding Handbook](./ai-coding-handbook.md)
**The Core Fundamentals.**
Start here to understand the anatomy of an AI coding session, including Skills, MCP, and the Artifact system.

### 2. [Thinking Models](./thinking-models.md)
**Understanding the "Brain".**
Learn how different AI models (like Reasoning models vs. Chat models) approach coding tasks and how to pick the right one.

### 3. [Retrieval & Context](./retrieval-and-context.md)
**The Data Layer.**
Understand how I search your codebase using **Indexing** and **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to give you accurate answers.

## 🛠️ How to use this for Learning
1. **Initial Setup:** Read the **Handbook** first to get oriented.
2. **On the Go:** Push these files to GitHub and use the GitHub mobile app to read them.
3. **Internalize:** As you work with me, try to identify when I am using a "Skill" or when a "Task" artifact is updated.
